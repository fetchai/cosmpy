## <a name="get"></a> Getting the Source

1. Fork the [repository][repo].
2. Clone your fork of the repository:

   ``` shell
   git clone git@github.com:<github username>/cosmpy.git
   ```

3. Define an `upstream` remote pointing back to the main CosmPy repository:

   ``` shell
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/fetchai/cosmpy.git
   ```

## <a name="setup"></a> Setting up a New Development Environment

1. Ensure you have Python (version `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12` or `3.13`) and [`poetry`][poetry].

2. ``` shell
   make new-env
   ```

   This will create a new virtual environment using poetry with the project and all the development dependencies installed.

   > We use <a href="https://python-poetry.org" target="_blank">poetry</a> to manage dependencies. All python specific dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml` and installed with the library. 
   > 
   > You can have more control on the installed dependencies by leveraging poetry's features.

3. ``` shell
   poetry shell
   ```

    To enter the virtual environment.

To [update the protobuf schemas](#protobuf) and generate their associated python types, you will need [Google Protocol Buffers][protobuf].

## <a name="dev"></a>Development

### <a name="general"></a>General code quality checks

To run general code quality checkers, formatters and linters:

- ``` shell
   make lint
  ```

  Automatically formats your code and sorts your imports, checks your code's quality and scans for any unused code.

- ``` shell
   make mypy
  ```

  Statically checks the correctness of the types.

- ``` shell
   make pylint
  ```

  Analyses the quality of your code.

- ``` shell
   make security
  ```

  Checks the code for known vulnerabilities and common security issues.

- ``` shell
   make clean
  ```

  Cleans your development environment and deletes temporary files and directories.

### <a name="docs"></a>Updating documentation

We use [`mkdocs`][mkdocs] and [`material-for-mkdocs`][material] for static documentation pages. To make changes to the documentation:

- ``` shell
   make docs-live
  ```
  <!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
  This starts a live-reloading docs server on localhost which you can access by going to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> in your browser. Making changes to the documentation automatically reloads this page, showing you the latest changes.
  <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
  To create a new documentation page, add a markdown file under `/docs/` and add a reference to this page in `mkdocs.yml` under `nav`.

### <a name="api"></a>Updating API documentation

If you've made changes to the core `cosmpy` package that affects the public API:

- ``` shell
   make generate-api-docs
  ```

  This regenerates the API docs. If pages are added/deleted, or there are changes in their structure, these need to be reflected manually in the `nav` section of `mkdocs.yaml`.

### <a name="deps"></a>Updating dependencies

We use [`poetry`][poetry] and `pyproject.toml` to manage the project's dependencies.

If you've made any changes to the dependencies (e.g. added/removed dependencies, or updated package version requirements):

- ``` shell
   poetry lock
  ```

  This re-locks the dependencies. Ensure that the `poetry.lock` file is pushed into the repository (by default it is).

- ``` shell
   make liccheck
  ```

  Checks that the licence for the library is correct, taking into account the licences for all dependencies, their dependencies and so forth.

### <a name="tests"></a>Tests

To test the project, we use `pytest`. To run the tests:

- ``` shell
   make test
  ```

  Runs all the tests.

- ``` shell
   make unit-test
   ```

  Runs all unit tests.

- ``` shell
   make integration-test
  ```

  Runs all integration tests.

- ``` shell
   make coverage-report
  ```

  Produces a coverage report (you should run tests using one of the above commands first).

### <a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous checks

- ``` shell
   make copyright-check
  ```

  Checks that all files have the correct copyright header (where applicable).

## <a name="protobuf"></a> Generating python types from Cosmos SDK protobuf schemas

This library uses python types which are generated (using [Google's Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) compiler) from protocol buffer schemas in the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) and [WasmD](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd).

When updating the Cosmos-SDK version that is supported by this library (see the version currently used under `COSMOS_SDK_VERSION` in [Makefile](Makefile)), you will need to fetch its corresponding protobuf schemas and generate their associated python types, replacing the existing ones.

> Note: This process has to be done only once when the Cosmos-SDK version supported by this library is changed.

> Note: To generate python types from Cosmos-SDK protobuf schemas, you will need [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) compiler. A guide on how to install it can be found [here](https://fetchai.github.io/oef-sdk-python/user/install.html#protobuf-compiler).

- To regenerate the protobuf schema files, run the following:

  ```bash
  make proto
  ```

>Note: For this library to be functional, only python types generated from protobuf schemas are required, not the schema files themselves.
> The schema files are fetched on-demand only to enable the generation of python types.
> Therefore, the schema files are intentionally stored as **local** files and are **NOT** checked in to this repository to minimise its filesystem footprint.

## <a name="localnode"></a> To set up a local Fetchai node

To set up a local Fetchai node refer to [this guide](https://network.fetch.ai/docs/guides/ledger/single-node-testnet/).

## <a name="dockernode"></a> To run a local Fetchai node in docker

You require [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your platform.

1. Place the following entrypoint script somewhere in your system (e.g `~/fetchd_docker/fetchd_initialise.sh`):

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # variables
    export VALIDATOR_KEY_NAME=validator
    export BOB_KEY_NAME=bob
    export VALIDATOR_MNEMONIC="erase weekend bid boss knee vintage goat syrup use tumble device album fortune water sweet maple kind degree toss owner crane half useless sleep"
    export BOB_MNEMONIC="account snack twist chef razor sing gain birth check identify unable vendor model utility fragile stadium turtle sun sail enemy violin either keep fiction"
    export PASSWORD="12345678"
    export CHAIN_ID=testing
    export DENOM_1=stake
    export DENOM_2=atestfet
    export MONIKER=some-moniker


    # Add keys
    ( echo "$VALIDATOR_MNEMONIC"; echo "$PASSWORD"; echo "$PASSWORD"; ) |fetchd keys add $VALIDATOR_KEY_NAME --recover
    ( echo "$BOB_MNEMONIC"; echo "$PASSWORD"; ) |fetchd keys add $BOB_KEY_NAME --recover

    # Configure node
    fetchd init --chain-id=$CHAIN_ID $MONIKER
    echo "$PASSWORD" |fetchd add-genesis-account $(fetchd keys show $VALIDATOR_KEY_NAME -a) 100000000000000000000000$DENOM_1
    echo "$PASSWORD" |fetchd add-genesis-account $(fetchd keys show $BOB_KEY_NAME -a) 100000000000000000000000$DENOM_2
    echo "$PASSWORD" |fetchd gentx $VALIDATOR_KEY_NAME 10000000000000000000000$DENOM_1 --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
    fetchd collect-gentxs

    # Enable rest-api
    sed -i '/^\[api\]$/,/^\[/ s/^enable = false/enable = true/' ~/.fetchd/config/app.toml
    sed -i '/^\[api\]$/,/^\[/ s/^swagger = false/swagger = true/' ~/.fetchd/config/app.toml
    fetchd start
    ```

2. Execute:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /scripts/<ENTRYPOINT-SCRIPT-NAME> -p 9090:9090 -p 1317:1317 --mount type=bind,source=<FULL-PATH-TO-ENTRYPOINT-SCRIPT>,destination=/scripts/ <FETCH-IMAGE-TAG>
    ```

    where

    - `<ENTRYPOINT-SCRIPT-NAME>` is the name of the entrypoint script (e.g.`fetchd_initialise.sh`)
    - `<PATH-TO-ENTRYPOINT-SCRIPT>` is the path to the directory you placed the script (e.g.`~/fetchd_docker/`),
    - `<FETCH-IMAGE-TAG>` is the tag of the FetchD docker image you want to run (e.g. `fetchai/fetchd:0.10.0` for Dorado)
